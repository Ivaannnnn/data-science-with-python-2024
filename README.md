# EDA and NVIDIA Stock Analysis (NVDA)

## üéØ Project Objective

This project aims to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Iris dataset** and **stock analysis** of **NVIDIA (NVDA)** using historical data. The goal is to uncover insights, patterns, and trends in the data to support decision-making, particularly in relation to NVIDIA's stock performance.

## üìä Datasets Used

### 1. Iris Dataset
   - This dataset is used for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). It contains information about three species of iris flowers and various features like sepal and petal length and width.
   - **Dataset Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

### 2. **NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Data**
   - This dataset contains historical stock prices of NVIDIA. It is used for analyzing stock trends, volatility, and for potential stock price prediction.
   - **Data Source:** [Yahoo Finance](https://www.finance.yahoo.com/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used

- **Python** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization.
- **yfinance** for fetching NVIDIA stock data.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for documentation and interactive analysis.

## üîç Analysis Summary

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset**
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for each feature.
   - **Data Visualizations**: Create **boxplots**, **pairplots**, and **heatmaps** to visualize the distribution and correlations between features.
   - **Patterns and Insights**: Analyze how species are distributed based on sepal and petal features.

### 2. **NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis**
   - **Fetching Stock Data**: Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve historical stock prices for NVIDIA.
   - **Stock Price Trends**: Plot **line charts** to visualize the stock price movement over time.
   - **Stock Volatility**: Calculate stock volatility using **moving averages** and **Bollinger Bands**.

Thank you for checking out the project! I hope the analysis provides valuable insights into the data and NVIDIA's stock performance.
